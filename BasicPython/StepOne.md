# Reading data from a file

At some point or another, most projects you might create with Python will
involve reading and/or writing to files.  So, a good place to start your
excursion with Python is doing that.  Along the way, we need to learn some
other skills and techniques.

# Variables and variable types

When doing work with data, there will often be a list of files that need
to be worked with.  One of the most common ways of doing that is to assign
each filename to a variable, then do something with that file, then move on
to the next filename.  We can't, of course, do that, until we know how to
assign values to variables.  So, let's start there.

```
filename = 'subj001'

```
